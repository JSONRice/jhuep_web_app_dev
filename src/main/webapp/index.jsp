New Horizons is a NASA space probe launched to study the dwarf planet Pluto, its moons and one or 
two other Kuiper belt objects, depending on which are in position to be explored. The intention is 
not to orbit these objects but to observe them as the probe flies by.

Part of the New Frontiers program, the mission was approved in 2001 after cancellation of Pluto Fast 
Flyby and Pluto Kuiper Express. The mission profile was proposed by a team led by principal investigator 
Alan Stern of Southwest Research Institute. After several delays on the launch site, New Horizons 
was launched on January 19, 2006, from Cape Canaveral, directly into an Earth-and-solar-escape trajectory 
with an Earth-relative speed of about 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph); it set 
the record for the highest launch speed of a human-made object from Earth.

After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its 
closest approach on February 28, 2007 at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). 
The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons‍ '​ speed by 
4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 9,000 mph). The encounter was also used as a general test of New Horizons‍ '​ 
scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Most 
of the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems, except for brief 
annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought back on-line for the encounter, and 
instrument check-out began. 

On January 15, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto, which will result 
in the first flyby of the dwarf planet on July 14, 2015.
