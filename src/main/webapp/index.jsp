New Horizons is a NASA space probe launched to study the dwarf planet Pluto, its 
moons and one or two other Kuiper belt objects, depending on which are in position 
to be explored. The intention is not to orbit these objects but to observe them 
as the probe flies by.

Part of the New Frontiers program, the mission was approved in 2001 after 
cancellation of Pluto Fast Flyby and Pluto Kuiper Express. The mission profile 
was proposed by a team led by principal investigator Alan Stern of Southwest 
Research Institute. After several delays on the launch site, New Horizons was 
launched on January 19, 2006, from Cape Canaveral, directly into an 
Earth-and-solar-escape trajectory with an Earth-relative speed of about 16.26 
kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph); it set the record for the highest 
launch speed of a human-made object from Earth.

After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to 
Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007 at a distance of 
2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity 
assist that increased New Horizons‍ '​ speed by 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 9,000 mph). The 
encounter was also used as a general test of New Horizons‍ '​ scientific capabilities, 
returning data about the planet's atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Most of 
the post-Jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems, 
except for brief annual checkouts. On December 6, 2014, New Horizons was brought 
back on-line for the encounter, and instrument check-out began. 

On January 15, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft began its approach phase to Pluto, 
which will result in the first flyby of the dwarf planet on July 14, 2015.
